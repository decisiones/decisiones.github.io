<p>During this stop, participants will be welcomed by highly qualified professionals from the Strategic Forest Planning Team, who will provide an in-depth overview of how the company&rsquo;s forestry operations are structured. The presentation will cover key aspects of operational support, logistical coordination, and post-planting monitoring, demonstrating how each step is meticulously planned to ensure efficiency, productivity, and environmental responsibility.</p>
<p>The team will also explain how forest management integrates landscape planning, the optimization of harvesting cycles, and sustainable practices that balance economic production with biodiversity conservation. This technical session will offer valuable insights into how Veracel’s planning processes contribute directly to the long-term sustainability of forest production within a mosaic landscape approach.</p>
<h1 id="afternoon-program">Afternoon Program</h1>
<p>In the afternoon, participants will take part in a technical visit to the eucalyptus harvest operation site. Guided by experienced professionals from the Forest Operations Team, the group will have the opportunity to observe the entire harvesting process in action, including the use of advanced forestry machinery such as harvesters and forwarders.</p>
<p>During this session, the team will present how the harvesting activities are meticulously planned and executed to ensure operational efficiency, safety, and environmental compliance. Participants will gain an understanding of how harvesting integrates with the company’s broader landscape management strategy, including considerations related to soil conservation, water resources protection, biodiversity preservation, and minimization of environmental impacts.</p>
<p>Additionally, there will be a stop dedicated to discussing the mosaic landscape model, where participants will learn how production areas are interspersed with preserved native forest fragments, contributing to ecosystem services, habitat connectivity, and long-term sustainability of the landscape.</p>
<p>This visit offers a unique opportunity to witness firsthand how modern forestry practices balance productive efficiency with environmental stewardship, showcasing a model of sustainable forest management in action.</p>
<h1 id="veracel"><a href="https://www.veracel.com.br/"><img src="/images/logoveracel.gif" alt="Veracel"></a></h1>
<p>Veracel Celulose is a leading Brazilian bioeconomy company based in southern Bahia, operating one of the largest pulp production facilities in Latin America. Formed as a joint venture between Stora Enso (Sweden-Finland) and Suzano (Brazil), Veracel integrates forest, industrial, and logistics operations, producing an average of 1.1 million tons of bleached eucalyptus pulp per year.</p>
<p>With a strong commitment to sustainable development, Veracel manages a forest base designed under the mosaic landscape model, which combines high-productivity eucalyptus plantations with the protection of extensive native forest areas. This strategy not only supports industrial production but also ensures biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services.</p>
<p>In addition to production, Veracel is a reference in socio-environmental responsibility, maintaining conservation areas such as the Private Reserve of Natural Heritage (RPPN) Estação Veracel, which protects approximately 6,000 hectares of Atlantic Forest, recognized by UNESCO as part of the Atlantic Forest Biosphere Reserve.</p>
<p>This field visit will provide an opportunity to understand the company’s forest management model, particularly the eucalyptus planting operations, which are designed to ensure sustainable productivity while preserving natural resources. Participants will observe how Veracel applies advanced forestry practices, integrates conservation areas, and balances economic production with environmental stewardship.</p>
