<p><img src="/images/APRUNVE.png" alt="APRUNVE"></p>
<p>APRUNVE is a rural producers’ association located in the countryside of Porto Seguro, near the Pau-Brasil National Park. The association brings together approximately 100 farming families, cultivating more than 50 different agricultural products, with a focus on coffee and cacao production.</p>
<p>The association plays a key role in strengthening family farming, with commercialization occurring both at local fairs in Porto Seguro and primarily through the Federal Food Purchase Program (PAA), which ensures income generation and food distribution.</p>
<p>A key social initiative within APRUNVE is the Women’s Agroecological Rural Producers Association (AMPRA), also known as “Associação Mulheres Guerreiras”. This group focuses on transforming agricultural surpluses into value-added products such as cakes, jams, juices, and artisanal liqueurs, fostering income generation and financial independence for the women of the community.</p>
<p>The visit to APRUNVE offers a practical understanding of how community-based agriculture, agroecological practices, and social organization contribute to rural development, food security, and economic resilience.</p>
